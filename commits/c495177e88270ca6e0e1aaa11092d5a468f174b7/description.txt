    feat(auth): handle a password change requirement in login
    
    When a password change is required the lockedAt flag is set, currently by an external script. Until the password is changed all sessions for such an account must be verified. The 'password-change' verificationReason is returned in the response to tell the frontend to show the change password ui. The resetAccount db procedure resets the lockedAt value to null when the password is changed.
