    style(settings): UnitRow, UnitRowWithAvatar, & Modal styles + Storybook, allow postcss imports
    
    Because:
    * Now that Tailwind is configured, we can style existing Settings components and the current layout.
    
    This commit:
    * Changes UnitRowWithImage to UnitRowWithAvatar because we likely will not reuse it
    * Styles Modal, UnitRow, and UnitRowWithAvatar across mobile, tablet, & desktop
    * Adds Modal, UnitRow, and UnitRowWithAvatar to Storybook
    * Adds postcss-import and sets a convention for shared class styles with Tailwind with ctas.scss, UnitRow.scss, and .link-blue
    * Modifies the shared close.svg
    
    fixes #5394
