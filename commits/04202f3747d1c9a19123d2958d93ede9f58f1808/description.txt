    feat(settings): Build out secondary emails with real data, add resend verification GQL mutation
    
    Because:
    * Secondary email states were hardcoded and we needed to reflect real account data.
    * Users need to be able to resend the verification code for unverified secondary emails.
    
    This commit:
    * Displays various secondary email states with real account data - none set with verified/unverified primary email, single/multi secondary emails set unverfied/verified.
    * Adds a functioning mutation for resendSecondaryEmailCode.
