    fix(settings): Fix layout and fixed nav width
    
    Because:
    * The main content layout was missing a class and the nav fixed width didn't render properly with long strings.
    
    This commit:
    * Adds 'w-full' class to the Nav/main container and 'transform' class to the nav container.
