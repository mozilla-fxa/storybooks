    feat(settings): Add Footer component
    
    Because:
    * The new settings page needs the footer with moz logo and links.
    
    This commit:
    * Moves Footer from fxa-admin-panel into fxa-react for use in admin-panel and
      new Settings, plus styles it per design in desktop, tablet, and mobile.
    * Adds some more tests in AppLayout.
    
    fixes #4868
