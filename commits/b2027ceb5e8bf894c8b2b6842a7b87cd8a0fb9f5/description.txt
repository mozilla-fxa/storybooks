    feat(settings): Add AlertBar root el, UnitRowSecondaryEmail
    
    Because:
    * We need to use the AlertBar component throughout the project while keeping it as the first DOM element after the main tag.
    
    This commit:
    * Adds 'alert-bar-root' element and uses createPortal in AlertBar to mount
    * Modifies the hook that sets focus on the element opening a modal, allowing for a 'triggerException' to allow AlertBar to take focus
    * Pulls the secondary email section into its own component
