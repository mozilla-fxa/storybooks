    refactor(settings): ui component followups
    
    Because:
    
    - There were still a few outstanding items to address as part of #6206
    
    This commit:
    
    - Eliminates all component `readerText` props. We determined they didn't add a substantial amount of value, and any accompanying a11y content can be implemented on a case-by-case basis.
    - As a result of removing readerText I also refactored the the usage of component IDs and was able to eliminate the UUID dependency.
    - Makes `DataBlock` only copyable. We currently don't have a need for a read-only version.
    - Further cleans up some leftover event handlers and weird syntax in the new components.</pre>
