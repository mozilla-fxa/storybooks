    refactor(fxa-shared): cleanup sentry and add exc route
    
    Because:
    
    * Sentry relocation didn't clean up reporting functionality from the
      service using it.
    * We had no way to verify exceptions are thrown and captured by Sentry.
    
    This commit:
    
    * Refactors the sentry reporting functionality so it can be used
      directly by other code.
    * Adds an __exception__ route with basic trigger protection to avoid
      excessive error reporting.
    
    Closes #6454</pre>
