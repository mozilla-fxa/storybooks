    Merge pull request #6117 from mozilla/fxa-20, r=@6a68
    
    ## Because
    
    - We shouldn't stop a user from logging in if we detect invalid utm params
    
    ## This pull request
    
    - Replaces the invalid utm param with `invalid` and logs a Sentry error. Hopefully we can see how often this happens and what RPs are sending
    - By replacing the utm param, it allows us to still submit the metrics
    
    ## Issue that this pull request solves
    
    Closes: #3673
