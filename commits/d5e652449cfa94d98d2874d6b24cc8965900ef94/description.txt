    Merge pull request #5806 from mozilla/train-177-fxa-2087, r=@chenba
    
    ## Because
    
    * Our QR code experiment cohorting rules were not grouping users correctly
    * QR code experiment had half the volume of users as SMS and non-sms groups
    * Targeted against train-177 since this is metrics related
    
    ## This commit
    
    * Updates our flow events matching based on https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/issues/5628#issuecomment-649739353
    * The previous rules were matching sign-in users only, the New Rules match sign-in/sign-up/direct flows
    
    ## Issue that this pull request solves
    
    Closes: #5628
