    Merge pull request #6082 from mozilla/fxa-2311, r=@vladikoff
    
    ## Because
    
    - We currently don't log any complete events when a user completes a login via pairing
    
    ## This pull request
    
    - Adds the `fxa_login - complete` event when the user finishes the pairing flow
    - Note that I was not able to add the `login_type` property to these events. I can do that part in a follow up.
    
    ## Issue that this pull request solves
    
    Closes: #5990
