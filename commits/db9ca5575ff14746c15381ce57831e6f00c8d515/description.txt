    ## Because
    
    * Commit status for overall project code coverage is non-nonsensical because it could be based on a commit that didn't necessarily run tests
    * We still report `patch` which shows the coverage of the current PR on the tests that did run
    
    ## This commit
    
    * Disables the `project` commit status.
