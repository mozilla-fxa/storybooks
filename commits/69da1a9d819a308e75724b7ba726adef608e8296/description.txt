    fix(admin-panel): stop using helmet.xssFilter because we don't want its default value
    
    Because:
    
    - Previously helmet.xssFilter() would set the X-XSS-Protection header to `1; mode=block`. As of v4 this value is no `0` (no XSS filtering). We want to keep this enabled.
    
    This commit:
    
    - Replace it with a simple middleware to return it to our desired original value
