    feat(settings): add ability to refresh account data via buttons in 2fa, secondary email, and recovery key sections
    
    Because:
    
    - We need to be able to refresh the statuses of an account's 2fa, secondary emails, and recovery key
    
    This commit:
    
    - Add refresh buttons to each unit row to accomplish this. This doesn't actually perform an update query on the specific section, but simply performs an account retrieval and updates the cache accordingly.</pre>
