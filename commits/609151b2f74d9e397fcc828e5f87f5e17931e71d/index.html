    feat(settings): build settings with content-server config interpolation
    
    Because:
    
    - Currently we are modifying the response of /beta/settings to include server config, which only applies to local development when we also need it for actual builds
    
    This commit:
    
    - Stops modifying any fxa-settings/fxa-content-server response to inject server config
    - Utilizes the already available interpolate-html-plugin provided by CRA to inject server config during builds, both in development and production</pre>
