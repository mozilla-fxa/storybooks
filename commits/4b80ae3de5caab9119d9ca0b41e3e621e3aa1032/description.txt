    chore(releases): add missing CHANGELOG files, mod release script to update them
    
    Because:
    
    - I noticed we were missing a few CHANGELOG.md files in our packages
    - We were also missing entries for a few packages to update the CHANGELOG files in the release script
    
    This commit:
    
    - Add the files
    - Update the script
