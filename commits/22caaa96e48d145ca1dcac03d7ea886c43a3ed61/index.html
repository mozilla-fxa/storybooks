    feat(a11y settings): Improve modal a11y
    
    This commit:
    *Allows the Modal component to close on escape key press
    *Shifts focus back to the element that opened the modal when closed via a new hook
    *Disallows interaction with root element when modal is opened via aria-hidden, pointer events, and scroll prevention
    *Adds aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, and role='dialog' properties
    *Adds a tab fence so screenreaders are directed to the modal after opening
    
    Because:
    The current modal component needed some accessibility improvements.
    
    Fixes #5016</pre>
