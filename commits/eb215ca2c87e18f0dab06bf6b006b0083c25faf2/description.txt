    fix(admin-panel): Fix connection to admin server in dev, remove unneeded Apollo dependencies, update README
    
    Because:
    * The admin panel can't connect to the admin server in development
    * We use '@apollo/client' in fxa-settings and should be consistent, preferring one package over a lot of separated dependencies
    
    This commit:
    * Changes the gql server port to 8095
    * Adds oidc-claim-id-token-email auth header in development
    * Removes react-apollo, apollo-boost, apollo-client etc. in favor of @apollo/client
    * Includes doc updates for admin-panel and admin-server
