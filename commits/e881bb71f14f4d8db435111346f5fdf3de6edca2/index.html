    refactor(settings): move type defs to a d.ts file so they're always available
    
    Because:
    
    - We currently export types from src/lib/types.ts, which is perfectly fine but requires an import any time you want to reference one
    
    This commit:
    
    - Moves definitions to the already-existing react-app-env.d.ts file so they're globally available. Note that this should not preclude you from defining single-use types in the same file as needed, and any enums will need to be in a standalone .ts file so they can be bundled with code.</pre>
