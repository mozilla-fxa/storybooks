    Merge pull request #6288 from mozilla/fxa-2427, r=@dannycoates
    
    ## Because
    
    - We should always try to prompt the user for 2FA if it is enabled on the account
    
    ## This pull request
    
    - For oauth webchannel clients (now FxiOS and Fenix) we shouldn't allow them to reuse a sessionToken which could lead to edge cases like these
    
    ## Issue that this pull request solves
    
    Closes: #6208
