    Merge pull request #5688 from mozilla/fix-enrollment-attempt, r=@6a68
    
    Fixes #5476 maybe?
    
    This removes the newsletterCadChooser check that should have in theory made the qr code and newsletter experiment exclusive. Since we are not running the newsletter experiment yet, it is probably safe to remove the check to see if it was interfering with the qr code experiment.
