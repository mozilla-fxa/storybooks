    ## Because
    
    - We need to have methods that can update and store the ecosystem anon id for a user
    
    ## This pull request
    
    - On loading the settings page, fetches and stores the anon id from the auth-server
    - Adds account model methods to generate and store ecosystemAnonId to localstorage and auth-server
    - Can generate `ecosystemAnonId` either from kB, using authentication token that can retrieve keys, or using password and sessionReauth
