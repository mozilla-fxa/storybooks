    refactor(settings): removed AccountDataHOC
    
    Because our assumptions about the data from gql have changed, we no longer need to worry about parts of the Account type needing a verified session, we can simplify the structure a bit.
    
    In the future we can use `useQuery` in components to get the data they need instead of pushing down the `account` object.
    
    This also introduces the `models` and `operations` folders for organizing types and read/write operations.</pre>
