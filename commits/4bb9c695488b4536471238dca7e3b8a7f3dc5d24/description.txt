    feat(settings): Pull account query into HOC, add Avatar component
    
    Because:
    * The Header and Nav components inside AppLayout need access to portions of the initial account query.
    * We need to display the avatar in multiple components.
    
    This commit:
    * Adds a HOC component of which AppLayout is a child of and moves the account query into this component and passes the data into AppLayout and Settings.
    * Creates the Avatar component and displays it correctly in Header.
    
    fixes #4898
