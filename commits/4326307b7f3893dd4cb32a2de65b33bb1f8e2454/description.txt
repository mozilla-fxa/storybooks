    Merge pull request #6131 from mozilla/fxa-1606, r=@jodyheavener
    
    ## Because
    
    - The new settings page needs navigation
    
    ## This pull request
    
    - Adds initial react reach routing and lazy loading with Suspense
    - Adds a basic `FlowContainer` component that acts as container for standalone views
    - There are still some rough edges around the styling that I hope can be addressed in #5028 (ie mobile view doesn't show the back arrow in correct spot)
    
    ## Issue that this pull request solves
    
    Closes: #4899
