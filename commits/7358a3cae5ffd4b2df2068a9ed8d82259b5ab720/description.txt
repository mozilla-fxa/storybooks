    feat(auth-client): replace fxa-js-client with fxa-auth-client
    
    - We have two clients for the auth-server API, one in `content-server/app/scripts/lib/auth` and `fxa-js-client`. The content-server one was meant to replace fxa-js-client but I didn't finish the work to get it running on nodejs.
    
    - Extracts the content-server implementation into `fxa-auth-client`
    - Wraps the implementation with shims to work with nodejs in `server.ts`
    - Updates references to fxa-js-client to use fxa-auth-client
    - Removes fxa-js-client
