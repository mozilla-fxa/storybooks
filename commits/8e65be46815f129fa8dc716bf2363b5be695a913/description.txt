    feat(settings): standardize error/success messages and reporting
    
    Because:
    
    - We perform many mutations and actions across Settings that require error/success messages. Some of the error instances should be reported to Sentry.
    
    This commit:
    
    - Tries to standardize how we show messages and report errors.
