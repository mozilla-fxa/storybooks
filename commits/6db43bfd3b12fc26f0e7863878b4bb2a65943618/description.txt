    chore: dependency updates
    
    Because:
    
    * We like to keep our dependencies up to date.
    * Using shared versions is more size efficient.
    
    This commit:
    
    * Updates dependencies for graphql-api where applicable.
    * Consolidates shared dependency updates to reduce the size.
