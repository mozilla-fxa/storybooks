    ## Because
    
    - Account created using a sync scoped token did not send the post verify account email, instead they sent the "new device login" email
    
    ## This pull request
    
    - Checks to see if the client doing the verification is using a clientId that is sync based and send the verification email if so
    - Updates oauth token route to see if the account is newish in order to send the "new device login" email
    
    ## Issue that this pull request solves
    
    Closes: #5920
