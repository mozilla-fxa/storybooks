    refactor(settings): Cleanup secondary email tests, catch mutation errors
    
    Because:
    * We setup many 'email' objects and need a helper for DRYer code
    * We must have an onError option in mutations to allow tests to pass
    
    This commit:
    * Gets tests passing and DRYs them up
    
    fixes #6192
