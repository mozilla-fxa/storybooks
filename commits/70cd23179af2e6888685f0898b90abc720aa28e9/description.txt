    Merge pull request #6383 from mozilla/issue-6347
    
    ## Because
    
    - We stopped emitting the `flow.complete` metrics for FF80 which we use in amplitue to signal that the user completed the specific action
    - For FF 80 we moved to a sync oauth flow and don't call the `/certificate/signed` anypoint anymore, which would have emitted the `account.signed` event.
    
    ## This pull request
    
    - Emits the `account.signed` event when an oauth token is created. If the flow has a `flowCompleteSignal=account.signed`, it will emit the `flow.complete` event.
    
    ## Issue that this pull request solves
    
    Closes: #6347
