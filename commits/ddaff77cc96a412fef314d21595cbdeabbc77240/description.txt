    fix(surveys): Provide context to screenreaders when entering the survey
    
    Because:
    * Without this fix, screenreaders hit the survey control button first without any context on what it is that they've just entered.
    
    This commit:
    * Changes the 'section' tag to an 'aside', as a 'complimentary' element to the main content seems more applicable, and adds a generic survey aria-label to provide screenreaders with context because we can't easily use an aria-labelledby and aria-describedby due to SurveyGizmo's dynamic IDs that will change with every survey.
