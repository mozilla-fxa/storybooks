    feat(settings): secondary email delete and make primary functionality
    
    Because:
    
    - We need to be able to delete a secondary email
    - We need to be able to make a verified secondary email primary
    - We need to be able to perform these actions after a session verification
    
    This commit:
    
    - Adds the delete secondary email button
    - Implements delete and make primary mutations
    - Adds support for all these actions when session needs to be verified
    - (bonus) add more styles to AlertBar</pre>
