    feat(settings): added fxa-auth-client to fxa-settings
    
    This provides the base functionality needed for fxa-settings to make api calls to the auth-server. There's an `AuthContext.Provider` initialized in index.tsx and the `useAuth` hook to retrieve the client from components.
    
    fixes #5491
