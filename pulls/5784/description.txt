    fix(build): added postinstall to fxa-shared
    
    In dev we want to be able to go from a `yarn install` to
    running code but we also want to keep typescript as a
    devDependency for production builds where we have an
    explicit build phase then --production install. To keep the
    production install from failing on the postinstall we need
    it to succeed even if tsc is missing, hence the `|| true`.
