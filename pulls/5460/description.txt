    feat(settings): Add header component
    
    This commit:
    * Moves Header and LogoLockup from the admin panel into fxa-settings
    * Adds relevant files to Storybook
    * Styles the Header with Tailwind classes and proper SVGs mobile through desktop
    
    Because:
    We need a dummy Header component to begin working off of.
    
    fixes #4865
