    feat(storybook): allow Tailwind scss compilation support
    Because:
    
    * Currently fxa-settings imports SCSS into a Tailwind file, but outside of Create React App (which handles SCSS compilation in the React app itself) SCSS is not compiled.
    
    This commit:
    
    * Updates both Tailwind and Storybook's setup so that you can now compile down to CSS or SCSS depending on your needs, and ensure Storybook's SCSS loader picks it up
